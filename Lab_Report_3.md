Lab Report 3 - Bugs and Commands (Week 5)
You’ll write this report as a Github Pages page, then print that page to PDF and upload to Gradescope.

Part 1 - Bugs
Choose one of the bugs from week 4's lab.

Provide:

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).
An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown).
The symptom, as the output of running the two tests above (provide it as a screenshot -- one test should pass, one test should fail).
The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown).
Briefly describe (2-3 sentences) why the fix addresses the issue.
Part 2 - Researching Commands
Consider the commands less, find, and grep. Choose one of them. Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the single command you chose. Many commands like these have pretty sophisticated behavior possible – it can take years to be exposed to and learn all of the possible tricks and inner workings. To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like “find command-line options” will probably give decent results. There is also a built-in command on many systems called man (short for “manual”) that displays information about commands; you can use man grep, for example, to see a long listing of information about how grep works. Also, consider asking ChatGPT!

For example, we saw the -name option for find in class.

Instruction: For each of those options, give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from ./technical. That makes 8 total examples, all focused on a single command. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s useful.

Along with each option/mode you show, cite your source for how you found out about it as a URL or a description of where you found it. See the syllabus on Academic Integrity and how to cite sources like ChatGPT for this class.
